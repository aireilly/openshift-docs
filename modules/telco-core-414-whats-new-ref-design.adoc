|Description

//CNF-7349
|Support for running rootless DPDK workloads with kernel access by using the TAP CNI plugin
a|DPDK applications that need to inject some traffic to the kernel can run in non-privileged pods with the help of the tap CNI plugin.

//CNF-5977
|Dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs for OVS
a|With this release, the Open vSwitch (OVS) networking stack can dynamically use non-reserved CPUs.
This dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs occurs by default in performance-tuned clusters with a CPU manager policy set to `static`.
The dynamic use of available, non-reserved CPUs maximizes compute resources for OVS and minimizes network latency for workloads during periods of high demand.
OVS remains unable to dynamically use isolated CPUs assigned to containers in `Guaranteed` QoS pods. This separation avoids disruption to critical application workloads.

//CNF-7760
|Enabling more control over the c-states for each pod
a|users are given more control over the c-states for their pods. Now instead of just disabling c-states completely users are able to specify a maximum latency in microseconds for the C-states. The additional configuration is available in the `cpu-c-states.crio.io` annotation and facilitates power savings in the high-priority applications by enabling some of the shallower c-states, instead of disabling them completely.
