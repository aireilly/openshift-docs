|Description

//CNF-7349 Rootless DPDK pods
|Support for running rootless DPDK workloads with kernel access by using the TAP CNI plugin
a|DPDK applications that need to inject some traffic to the kernel can run in non-privileged pods with the help of the TAP CNI plugin.

//CNF-5977 Better pinning of the networking stack
|Dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs for OVS
a|With this release, the Open vSwitch (OVS) networking stack can dynamically use non-reserved CPUs.
This dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs occurs by default in performance-tuned clusters with a CPU manager policy set to `static`.
The dynamic use of available, non-reserved CPUs maximizes compute resources for OVS and minimizes network latency for workloads during periods of high demand.
OVS remains unable to dynamically use isolated CPUs assigned to containers in `Guaranteed` QoS pods. This separation avoids disruption to critical application workloads.

//CNF-7760
|Enabling more control over the C-states for each pod
a|You have more control over the C-states for your pods. Now, instead of disabling C-states completely, you can specify a maximum latency in microseconds for C-states. You can configure this option in the `cpu-c-states.crio.io` annotation, which helps to optimize power savings in high-priority applications by enabling some of the shallower C-states instead of disabling them completely.

//CNF-7741 Permit to disable NUMA Aware scheduling hints based on SR-IOV VFs
|Exclude SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling.
a|You can exclude advertising the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node for the SR-IOV network to the Topology Manager. By not advertising the NUMA node for the SR-IOV network, you can permit more flexible SR-IOV network deployments during NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

For example, in some scenarios, it is a priority to maximize CPU and memory resources for a pod on a single NUMA node. By not providing a hint to the Topology Manager about the NUMA node for the podâ€™s SR-IOV network resource, the Topology Manager can deploy the SR-IOV network resource and the pod CPU and memory resources to different NUMA nodes. In earlier {product-title} releases, the Topology Manager attempted to place all resources on the same NUMA node only.

//CNF-8035 MetalLB VRF Egress interface selection with VRFs (Tech Preview)
|Egress service resource to manage egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer (Technology Preview)
a|With this update, you can use an `EgressService` custom resource (CR) to manage egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer service. This is available as a Technology Preview feature.

You can use the `EgressService` CR to manage egress traffic in the following ways:

* Assign the load balancer service's IP address as the source IP address of egress traffic for pods behind the load balancer service.

* Assign the egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer to a different network than the default node network.
