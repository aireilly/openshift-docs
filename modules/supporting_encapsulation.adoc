= Supporting encapsulation

As an OpenShift support engineer or developer, you want to inspect Kubernetes-specific mountpoints.

== Locating the encapsulated namespaces

Any monitoring tool that relies on the ability to run in the host OS and have visibility of mountpoints created by Kubelet, the Container Runtime, or containers themselves, will need to enter the container mount namespace in order to see these mountpoints.

[source,yaml]
----
  sh-4.4# readlink /proc/$(pgrep kubelet)/ns/mnt
  sh-4.4# readlink /proc/$(pgrep crio)/ns/mnt
----


== Inspecting the encapsulated namespaces

An administrator logged in to the host OS wishing to obtain information about the Kubernetes system for debugging or auditing purposes will need to be aware of the new mount namespace, and will need to run `nsenter` to view or interact with these mountpoints.

Issue the following command:
[source,yaml]
----
$ nsenter nsenter --mount=/run/container-mount-namespace/mnt ... <parameters ...> ...
----

Example output:

[source,yaml]
----
output from $ nsenter nsenter --mount=/run/container-mount-namespace/mnt ... <parameters ...> here
----
