= Configuring dynamic leap seconds handling for PTP grandmaster clocks

The PTP Operator container image includes the latest `leap-seconds.list` file at the time of release.
You can configure the PTP Operator to automatically update the leap second file by using GPS announcements.
Leap second information is stored in a `leap-configmap` custom resource (CR) in the `openshift-ptp` namespace.
The PTP Operator mounts the `leap-configmap` CR as a volume in the `linuxptp-daemon` pod.
The `ts2phc` process can access the local copy of the `leap-seconds.list` file.
If the GPS satellite broadcasts new leap second data, the PTP Operator updates the local copy with the new data.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
