= Disconnected Environment


Description::
Telco Core clusters are expected to be installed in networks without
direct access to the internet. All container images needed to install,
configure and operator the cluster must be available in a disconnected
registry. This includes OCP images, day-2 OLM Operator images, and
application workload images. The use of a disconnected environment
provides multiple benefits

* Limiting access to the cluster for security.
* Curated content â€“ The registry is populated based on curated/approved
updates for the clusters

Limits and requirements::

* A unique name is required for all custom CatalogSources. Do not reuse
the default catalog names.
